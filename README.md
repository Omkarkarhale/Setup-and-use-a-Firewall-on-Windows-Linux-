# Setup-and-use-a-Firewall-on-Windows-Linux-

This project demonstrates foundational firewall management skills and an understanding of network traffic filtering using Windows Firewall. Instead of blocking a specific port (as originally intended), this walkthrough blocks a **specific program (Google Chrome)** using **inbound and outbound rules**, showcasing similar concepts of traffic control.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Performed

### 1. Open Firewall Configuration Tool
- Open **Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security** via Start Menu or Control Panel.

### 2. List Current Firewall Rules
- Navigate to **Inbound Rules** and **Outbound Rules** to view existing entries.

### 3. Block Inbound & Outbound Traffic for Chrome
- Go to **Inbound Rules > New Rule**.
- Select **Program**, then browse and select `chrome.exe`.

- Choose **Block the connection**.

<img width="1214" alt="6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28e1bde9-25cc-4865-86fa-9c2ab26e7e9d" />
- Apply the rule to **Domain, Private, and Public** profiles.
- Name the rule (e.g., `ChromeIn`).

- Repeat the process in **Outbound Rules** to block outgoing connections.

### 4. Test the Rule
- Open Google Chrome and try accessing a website.
- The connection should fail due to the rule blocking network traffic.

### 5. Remove test block rule to restore original state.
- Go to the inbound and outbound rules and simply delete the rules you have created.
- And now, the program should gain access to the internet again


#### üö´ Blocking a Specific Port (Example with Port 25 - Telnet)
*Same steps as above, but select "Port" instead of "Program" in the rule creation process.*

## üß† Firewall Traffic Filtering Summary
Firewalls act as a barrier between your computer and potential threats from the internet. They use **rules** to determine whether to **allow or block** incoming and outgoing traffic based on:

| Filter Criteria   | Description                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Program Path      | Blocks or allows apps by their executable  |
| Port Number       | Filters traffic by specific TCP/UDP ports  |
| Protocol          | Applies rules to TCP, UDP, or both          |
| IP Addresses      | Controls traffic from/to specific IPs       |
| Network Profiles  | Applies to Domain, Private, or Public networks |
